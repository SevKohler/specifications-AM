= Extended Meta-data Guide

This section documents the use of the `description/other_details` meta-data subsection of an ADL 1.4 archetype. The meta-data items described here correspond to requirements discovered since the publication of the ADL and AOM 1.4 standards, and are designed to enable forward compatibility with ADL/AOM 2.

They are divided into two groups. The first set consists of standardised items whose naming and rules should be followed, and which are intended to be implemented by any ADL 1.4 => ADL 2 conversion tool. The second set consists of items that have been used publicly by at least one organisation and should be considered either candidates for standardisation, or else as item names reserved from other use (i.e. to avoid future clashes).

Note that since the syntax structure of the `other_details` subsection is a `Hash <String, String>`, all values are just strings. However, some internal syntax rules are imposed or suggested to enable smart parsing to generate more complex structures. An example is the use of the typical string for a person or organisation of the form "name <URN>", which enables email addresses, website URLs etc to be easily extracted.

== Standardised Items

The standard items are defined as follows:

[cols="2,4,3",options="header"]

|Item	                    |String syntax                                                         | Description
