== File-naming Convention

Up until ADL 1.4, archetypes were expressed in 'flat' form ADL and were saved in files with the extension `.adl`. These are now treated as legacy flat format files. Beginning with ADL 2, the source file format of an archetype is the 'differential' form, with the extension `.adls`. The flat format generated by tools now has the extension `.adlf`.
