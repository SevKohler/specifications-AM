== Terminology Section

Specialisation in the `terminology` section manifests in terms of specialised and added terms in the `term_definitions` sub-section.

Value sets can be specialised, which has the effect in the flattened form of replacing the original rather than adding to it, as shown in the following example.

The flattened result always includes the sum of term definitions from the parent.
