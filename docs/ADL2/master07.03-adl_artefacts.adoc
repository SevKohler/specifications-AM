For specialised archetypes, differential form follows the object-oriented convention and only includes overridden or new elements but not unchanged inherited elements. Inherited elements are determined by compiling and 'flattening' a differential archetype with respect to the parent archetypes in its _inheritance lineage_ .

For top-level archetypes the full structure is included in the differential file, but internal references, where they exist, are expanded out in the flat form.
