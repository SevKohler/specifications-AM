== The Environment

This specification is designed to address the need for reliable identification and referencing of complex knowledge artefacts within a distributed authoring and consumption environment. The figure below establishes the key concepts and nomenclature assumed by this specification. The focus of interest is ‘artefacts’, including archetypes, templates (of the archetype variety), terminology subsets/ref-sets, query sets, and potentially things such as computable guidelines.

Artefacts are assumed to be produced by tools, either in an unmanaged way, or in a situation in which users are connected to an artefact Custodian Organisation (CO). Such an organisation is assumed to have a Repository (which stores and manages artefacts), and potentially a Registry (in which meta-data about artefacts is stored) and Classification (a semantic index on Artefacts, typically achieved via the use of one or more ontologies). A Custodian Organisation could be international, country level, or be owned by a company or other organisation.

Most MOs will tend to develop artefacts based on those published by ‘higher-level’ (i.e. national, international) MOs. To enable this, a logical ability to re-use specified releases of artefacts from ‘upstream’ MOs by ‘downstream’ MOs is assumed. This usually implies some kind of virtual inclusion (e.g. from one web-visible repository to another), or it may be implemented by copying and marking as read-only the received artefacts. Regardless of the particular implementation, the ‘logical contents’ of a repository is the totality of localy managed artefacts, plus all virtually referenced artefact libraries. This is necessary to enable most compiler-like tools to function normally.

It is assumed that Artefacts can also move between MOs for purposes of transfer, or due to ‘forking’ (i.e. splitting of a line of development, as with software). Artefacts are published in some form and consumer by User Enterprises which deploy the artefacts in some technical infrastructure.

Artefacts are ultimately consumed by User Enterprises, normally in a validated and compiled form.

== The Problem

The problem specifically addressed by this specification is that of identification and referencing of knowledge artefacts. The notion of ‘identification’ for such artefacts incorporates a number of key requirements. The kinds of models in scope include archetypes (<<openehr_aom2>>, <<openehr_adl2>>), templates (<<openehr_templates>>), terminology subsets (See e.g. <<IHTSDO>>), clinical guidelines, query sets and other non-atomic domain level definitions of content, rules, workflows and other semantics. The common aspects of artefacts within this scope is that they are ‘outside the software’, and that they are independent of specific implementation technologies. Examples include:

* an archetype for ‘blood gases’;
* a template for ‘discharge summary’;
* a SNOMED CT subset for ‘parasitic infection’.

Out of scope are the atomic ‘concepts’ and ‘categories’ commonly found in terminologies (e.g.: ICD10, SNOMED CT, LOINC) and ontologies (e.g. the BFO ontologies such as OGMS, FMA, IAO etc).

Extensive experience with such artefacts in the health domain has shown that while there are many similarities to software artefact identification, there are sufficient differences to warrant an explicit scheme. The health domain is the primary domain of experience assumed here, but the principles are applicable to any domain.

The key requirements addressed here are as follows:

* identify and distinguish versions, variants and releases of ‘source’ artefacts within and from authoring environments;
* define rules for expressing and resolving references between source artefacts, including version variants;
* define rules for identification of compiled / operational artefacts;
* define rules for evolving identifiers (including version) of artefacts over time, based on a ‘standard’ lifecycle for artefacts;
* define rules for identification when artefacts are retired, moved or ‘forked’.

== Human-readable and Machine Identifiers

There are two general approaches to identification. The first is the one used in software and ontology development: human-readable identifiers, denoted in this specification as HRIDs. Under this approach, identifiers name an artefact (e.g. a class in object-oriented software, category in an ontology) and can be used as references to connect similar artefacts in a hierarchy (e.g. according to the inheritance relationship). The second is the use of meaningless machine identifiers (more properly denoted ‘machine-readable’ or ‘machine-resolvable’ identifiers) such as GUIDs and ISO OIDs with accompanying de-referencing mechanisms. The two approaches are not mutually exclusive, nor are they equivalent.

A human-readable identification scheme supports the notion of a specialsiation / subsumption hierarchy of artefacts (‘inheritance’ in object programming), multi-dimensional concept spaces, flexible versioning, and formally reflects the artefact authors' and users' understanding of the concept space being modelled. Human-readable identification supports many types of computational processing. A typical software HRID is the class name _FastSortedList_ . Within the software world, HRIDs are used for both source artefacts and built components such as libraries and executables, although the details of the respective types of identifier may differ.

One crucial feature of most human-readable identifiers is that they may change after initial assignment, for reasons of change of purpose, improved understanding of need, or external requirements change. These kinds of changes are normally limited to the early development (typically pre v1.0 phase) period in order to enable stability later on.

Machine identifiers on the other hand are not human-readable, typically do not directly support versioning (unless specifically designed to do so, usually via the use of tuples of atomic identifiers), but do enable various useful kinds of computation. They require mapping to convert to human-readable identifiers. Unlike human-readable identifiers, machine identifiers do not normally change once assigned.

One key question when using machine identifiers is: what do the identify? A logical artefact, which may exist in several minor and major versions? Each minor version? Each textually different variant that is committed to a repository? For each of these, a scheme has to be devised that correctly identifies the thing to be tracked.

It is possible to define an identification scheme in which either or both human-readable and machine identifiers are used. In schemes where machine identification alone is used, all human artefact 'identification' is relegated to meta-data description, such as names, purpose, and so on. One problem with such schemes is that meta-data characteristics are informal, and therefore can clash – preventing any formalisation of the ontological space occupied by the artefacts. Discovery of overlaps and in fact any comparative feature of artefacts cannot be easily formalised, and therefore cannot be made properly computable.

The approach assumed here is to use both types of identifier in the following way:

* a Guid is assigned to a knowledge artefact when it is created. It does not change, no matter what changes are made to the definition of the artefact. This enables authoring and model repository tools to track artefacts as they are modified over time.
* one or more namespaced HRIDs for an artefact can be computed from various properties of the artefact. Which properties will depend on the type of artefact.
* the last committed ‘build’ of an artefact (i.e. most recent version containing a change, no matter how small) can be identified in two ways:
* using a ‘build’ number that is part of the version identification of the artefact;
* via a hash on a canonical serialisation of the artefact.

This is a departure from the common situation where no machine identifier is assigned, and the artefact HRID is a static string, rather like a source file filename.

== Meta-data

A solution for identification that includes human readable (formal) identifiers unavoidably implicates the ‘meta-data’ of the identified artefacts, since such identifiers are normally created from smaller items such as ‘reference model class’, ‘version’, ‘namespace’ and so on. However, some items of meta-data are not appropriate for inclusion in an artefact, and would be created in the Registry instead. A general rule is that this applies to any item of information that may change without affecting the semantics of the artefact, and whose change should not require revision of the artefact itself. Examples of such information: ontological classification(s); ‘ownership’ status.

This specification assumes that an artefact management environment includes such a registry, and that some items of meta-data can be stored outside the artefacts themselves.
