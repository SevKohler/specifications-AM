h|*Class*
2+^h|*C_TIME*

h|*Description*
2+a|ISO 8601-compatible constraint on instances of Time in the form either of a set of validity values, or else date ranges based on the C_ORDERED list constraint. There is no validity flag for ‘hour’, since it must always be by definition mandatory in order to have a sensible time at all. Syntax expressions of instances of this class include “HH:??:xx” (time with optional minutes and seconds not allowed).
